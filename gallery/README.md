# Gallery

If you use ForColormap in your simulations, you can sent us screenshots with details to put in this gallery:

* `black_body-Waveguide-BPM2D-TM_mode.png`: a simulation of a 4-µm wide InGaAsP/InP waveguide with bends, using a 2D-Finite Difference Beam Propagation Method (at 1.55-µm wavelength). It is a top view (700x40 µm) with light propagating from left to right, visualized with the "black_body" colormap. Author: Vincent Magnin (IEMN - UMR CNRS 8520).
* `lipari-MMI-optical-splitter-BPM3D-TE_mode.png`: a simulation of a 1x2 Multi Mode Interferometer (MMI) splitter, with 800-nm wide Si3N4/SiO2 nanoguides on a GaAs substrate, using a 3D-Finite Difference Beam Propagation Method (at 1.55-µm wavelength). Light is injected by an optical fiber (diffraction is visible at the input). It is a top view (336x20 µm) with light propagating from left to right, visualized with the "lipari" colormap. Author: Vincent Magnin (IEMN - UMR CNRS 8520).
* `lajolla_reaction_diffusion.png`: Turing patterns obtained with the Gray and Scott's [Reaction Diffusion](https://github.com/vmagnin/gtk-fortran-extra/tree/main/reaction_diffusion) algorithm. The colormap is "lajolla". Author: Vincent Magnin.
