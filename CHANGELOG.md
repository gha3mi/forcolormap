## [forcolormap dev]

### Added
* A private `check()` method in the Colormap class. It checks the validity of the colormap and its parameters, prints warnings, and fixes problems if necessary.
* A `colormaps_list/ForColormap.pdf` manual listing all the available colormaps.
* A function `bezier(colors, levels)` to create a colormap from continuous Bezier interpolation of control colors, in `src/colormap_class.f90`. The corresponding demo was added in `example/demo.f90`.
* A link toward the page *ForColormap Collection Categories* was added in the `README.md` to help users choose a colormap.
* A GitHub workflow for the CMake build by @jchristopherson.
* CMake support by @jchristopherson.
* A `logo` directory with SVG files by @aslozada.
* A `black_body` colormap (`miscellaneous_colormaps` module).
* An `extract()` type-bound procedure to the Colormap type to extract colors from a colormap. The extracted number should be within the range [2, levels].
  * `example/extract.f90`
* Two private functions: `scale_real_real` and `scale_real_int`.
* The `src/colormaps_info.f90` module contains information about colormaps, that can be printed or written in the terminal or to a `.md` file. Information can be filtered  based on 8 parameters and printed in 4 different ways.
  * `example/info.f90`
  * `COLORMAPS_LIST.md`: generated by the module.
* A `README.md` file in each subdirectory describing the files inside.
* The discrete colormaps of the *Scientific Colour Maps* collection, thanks to the `scripts/gpl_to_lut.f90` program.
* A `TODO.md` file.
* A `reverse` boolean option was added to the methods `set`, `create`, and `load` to reverse a colormap.
  * An `example/demo_reverse.f90` example.
* The "magma", "inferno","plasma", "viridis" matplotlib colormaps in a `matplotlib_colormaps` module.
* A `colormap_parameters` module.
* A `miscellaneous_colormaps` module.
* A `colorbar()` type-bound procedure to write a PPM file with the colorbar.

### Changed
* `TODO.md` was refactored and renamed `ROADMAP.md`.
* Code refactoring.
* Moved `test` subroutine to demo and example1.
* Renamed `get_current()` to `get_name()`.
* For writing PPM files, the project [ForImage](https://github.com/gha3mi/forimage) by @gha3mi is now used as a fpm dependency. The related example must now be launched with `fpm run --example example1` and the ForColormap demo by `fpm run --example demo`.
* `src/colormap_class.f90`: `private` statement is now the default.

### Removed
* `scripts/cp_lut_files.sh` since its functionality is now included in the `scripts/gpl_to_lut.f90` program.
* The naive "grey" colormap: you should use "grayC" instead.
* And the "inverted_grey" colormap which can now be obtained from "grayC" with the `reverse=.true.` option.
